# NavierStokesSimulation
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Navier-Stokes equations for simulating fluid dynamics. The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluid substances and are fundamental in the field of fluid mechanics.

# Usage
Render a .avi simulation using the following command:
```py
python3 main.py
```

You can edit the simulation paramters at the start of `main.py` to change the resulting simulation.You can edit the simulation paramters at the start of `main.py` to change the resulting simulation.
